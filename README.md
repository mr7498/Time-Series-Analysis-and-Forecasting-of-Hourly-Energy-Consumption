# Time-Series-Analysis-and-Forecasting-of-Hourly-Energy-Consumption using XGBoost
➤ The projects aim was to time series forecasting using a machine learning model XGBoost (Linear regression) to predict energy consumption with python.
➤ For visualizing of data I have used matplotlib and seaborn libraries.
➤ Discovered types of time series data such as Seasonal pattern growth, Curvilinear trend, increasing linear trend and Cyclic.
